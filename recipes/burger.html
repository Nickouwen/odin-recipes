    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a reproduction of J. Kenzi Lopez-Alt's Oklahoma Onion Burger, taken from his recipe posted on his website <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/oklahoma-onion-burger-recipe" target="_blank">Serious Eats</a>. The recipe is a take on the smash burger. By preparing the recipe this way, it manages to keep the patty of the hamburger juicy while getting the crispy edges and flat patties that are indicative of a smash burger.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>(Ingredients list taken from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/oklahoma-onion-burger-recipe" target="_blank">Serious Eats</a>)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 tsp canola oil</li>
        <li>5 ounces fresh ground beef, divided in two</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>2 soft hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Mustard, pickles and other condiments if desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread canola oil inside a large cast iron skillet with a paper towel. Heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add balls of beef and press down with the back side of your spatula until completely flattened. Season generously with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Working quickly, spread onions evenly over the cooking burgers and press down to embed the onions in the meat. Let cook with no further pressing until burgers are brown on the edges. Roughly 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Carefully flip burgers with a stiff spatula, making sure to pick up all the browned meat from the skillet. Let cook until onions start to soften, about 1 minute. Add cheese and the top bun. Place bottom bun upside down over top but to allow steam to soften the bun</li>
        <li>When buns soften, transfer to a plate. Add condiments if desired. Lift up onions, burger and top bun together and transfer to bottom bun</li>
    </ol>
